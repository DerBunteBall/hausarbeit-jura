This is the current version of the class “hausarbeit-jura” for 
writing “juristische Hausarbeiten” at German universities. It 
was originally developed for a workshop at Trier University.

The idea is to make using LaTeX easier as only a few macros and environments 
are needed.

The documentation is in German only.
